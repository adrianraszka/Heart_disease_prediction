        <h1 class="display-4">Heart Disease</h1>
        <p class="lead">Alright so the challenge here is to scrap each block and compile your dataset.
          Afterwards, apply a machine learning algorithm to determine if someone has a presence of heart disease.

          This data is very clean and you do not need to process it further.  Just put it all together similar to
          an Excel table, seperate the Y values (the presence in this case), and train your algorithm.

          Original Dataset can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/downloads/heart-disease-uci.zip/1">here</a>.

          Python libraries that help with data science and machine learning arePandas, Numpy, and Scikit-Learn.
          For webscraping use Selenium.  I am dispersing the data using JavaScript so, its more difficult to use 
          any other means than Selenium.
